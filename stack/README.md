## What is a stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. A stack uses `Last in First Out`. A real world example of a stack could be a stack of plates sitting in your cabnet, the plate you put on top of the stack last, will be the firset plate you use next.

## Features
- [x] empty() - Returns wheter the stack is empty - Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- [x] size() - Returns the size of the stack - Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- [x] top()/peek() - Returns a reference to teh topmost element of the stack - Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- [x] puash(a) - Inserts the element `a` at the top of the stack - Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- [x] pop() - Deletes the topmost element of the stack - Time Complexity:` O(1)`
